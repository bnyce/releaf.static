They use special designs called biomimicry and fractals to help plants grow better. In the gardens, there is something called a VertiCan that looks like a tall tube with a hole in the bottom. It helps water flow slowly so plants can drink it without getting too wet. The roots of the plants also grow in a special pattern that helps them get more nutrients. The gardens also attract lots of tiny creatures that help the soil stay healthy. The gardens can be stacked up to make big walls covered in plants, just like a forest.</span></p></div>

Now, if you want to make your planter even better, you can add some other things to it! You can put a string inside the can to help the water get to the roots of the plant. Or, you could connect a bunch of planters together so they all get watered at the same time.</span></p></div>
