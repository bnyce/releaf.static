The roots of the plants also grow in a special pattern that helps them get more nutrients. The gardens also attract lots of tiny creatures that help the soil stay healthy.

First, you need to clean the can really well with soap and water. Then, you can make some holes in the bottom of the can so the water can drain out. But be careful and wear gloves so you don't hurt yourself! Now, if you want to make your planter even better, you can add some other things to it! You can put a string inside the can to help the water get to the roots of the plant. Or, you could connect a bunch of planters together so they all get watered at the same time.</span></p></div>
