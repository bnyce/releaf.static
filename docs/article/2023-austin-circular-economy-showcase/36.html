</ol><h3>What stage is your business in?</h3>

<p>ReLeaf is currently in the exciting start-up phase, having launched a promising business model that we're actively nurturing. We have begun partnering with local businesses in Austin to provide waste transformation services, turning waste into living vertical gardens, thus kick-starting the cycle of waste-to-wealth.</p>

<p>We are in the process of extending our customer base, which includes businesses, individuals, schools, and organizations who have shown an interest in enhancing their green infrastructure. Simultaneously, we're refining our service offerings based on feedback and experiences, allowing us to provide better and more efficient solutions.</p>

<p>Our online platform, ReLeaf.site, is gaining traction, becoming a vital tool for community education, engagement, and inventory management. Through it, we've started an Augmented Reality game, blending fiction and reality, and inviting the community to take part in our mission of sustainability.</p>

<p>We're also working to strengthen our relationships with key partners, aiming to create a robust network of businesses, suppliers, and individuals committed to a circular economy.</p>

<p>While we're proud of the progress we've made so far, we recognize that there's a long journey ahead of us. Winning this competition would be a tremendous boost in supporting our operations and helping us expand our impact.</p>

<h3>Explain how your company uses a circular economy framework</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>ReLeaf embodies the circular economy principles in its core operations.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We perceive waste not as an expendable element, but as a resource misplaced, packed with untapped potential. Our key activity revolves around transforming waste from businesses into modular vertical gardens - a tangible embodiment of green infrastructure. In doing so, we cultivate relationships with our customer segments, which include local businesses and community members, by providing cost-efficient waste management services and opportunities to participate in our sustainability initiatives.</p>

<p>Our platform, ReLeaf.site, is a vital channel that aids in spreading education about circular economy practices, inviting creativity through narratives tied to our products, and managing our inventory transparently. Simultaneously, it offers opportunities for residual income generation by upcycling vertical spaces in Austin.</p>

<p>In collaboration with our key partners - local businesses, schools, environmental agencies, and community organizations - we conduct workshops, enhancing circular economy understanding and skills. Revenue is generated not only from our waste transformation service but also from these educational programs, creating a self-sustaining cycle of waste-to-wealth. This cyclical approach fuels our business, contributes to Austin's sustainability, and reinforces our commitment to a circular economy.</p>

<h3>Circular Showcase Information</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We're pitching ReLeafâ€™s unique waste transformation service, which breathes new life into what's typically discarded.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through this service, we partner with Austin-based businesses, turning their waste into lush living walls, the core product of our venture. We then provide these modular vertical gardens to individuals, businesses, schools, and organizations, contributing to the green infrastructure of Austin.</p>

<p>In addition to the waste transformation service, we offer an interactive and educational platform, ReLeaf.site, serving as a channel for engagement and education. On this platform, community members can learn about sustainable practices, contribute to creative storytelling linked with our products, and participate in our emerging augmented reality game, providing a unique blend of education, entertainment, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Through our consulting services, we help businesses reduce waste disposal costs and contribute to their city's sustainability efforts. This proactive involvement not only generates a new stream of income but also establishes stronger ties with the community.</p>

<p>In essence, we're not just pitching a service but a holistic business concept centered around circular economy principles. By transforming waste into wealth and fostering community engagement, we're redefining waste management and contributing to a greener, more sustainable Austin.</p>

<h3>If selected as the winner, what will the prize money specifically be used for?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If awarded the prize, the funds will primarily be allocated towards enhancing our operational capabilities, allowing us to amplify our waste transformation service and create more modular vertical gardens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, we aim to invest in more efficient tools and equipment to expedite the waste transformation process, bolstering the production of living walls. This will, in turn, help us scale our services and reach more businesses and communities in Austin.</p>

<p>Furthermore, consistent with our ethos, a significant portion of the funds will be dedicated to ensuring fair wages for our team. We believe that the backbone of our success lies in our dedicated workforce and, as such, we aim to provide them with just compensation.</p>

<p>Additionally, we plan to use a portion of the prize money to enhance our online platform, ReLeaf.site, improving its user interface, enhancing the educational resources, and expanding the features of our augmented reality game.</p>

<p>Finally, a segment of the funding will be set aside to foster the creation of residual income streams for our partners who participate in upcycling vertical spaces, allowing us to further solidify our business model and ensure our continued contribution to creating a sustainable future in Austin.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="../../waste-integration.html" hreflang="en">Waste Integration</a>
