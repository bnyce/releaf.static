They are called ReLeafs Vertical Gardens and they have stories inside them. The stories are about the city's history and the people who live there. You can learn about musicians, buildings, and lots of other things by scanning a special code on the garden. When you give money to support the storytellers, a leaf on the garden lights up! These gardens are not just pretty, they help us remember the past and keep it alive. They make the city more fun and interesting to explore!</span></p></div>

So, there are some people who are really worried about the planet and how we treat it. They want to make sure that we all work together to take care of the earth and all the living things on it. One of these people, Donna Haraway, wrote a book called Staying with the Trouble Making Kin in the Chthulucene. In her book, she talks about how we need to think about the earth and all the living things on it like we are all part of a big family. She even came up with a special word, Chthulucene, to describe this new way of thinking.</span></p></div>

They make our spaces look pretty and help us use rainwater in a smart way. Rainwater goes through a maze of plants and soil, just like a marble goes through a maze in a game. The design of the garden is important to make sure the plants get enough water. The plants grow bigger and their roots make a network that helps them get even more water. It's like a big puzzle that the rainwater has to solve to get to all the plants. The more the plants grow, the more rainwater they can collect and use.</span></p></div>
