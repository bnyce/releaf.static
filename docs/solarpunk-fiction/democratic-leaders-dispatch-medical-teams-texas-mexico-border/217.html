Abbott said that since 2021 “Texas has spent more than $4.5bn on essential border health operations, and the Texas legislature is currently contemplating an additional $4.6bn for the next two years.”</p><p>State personnel do not have the power to process people crossing the US-Mexico border to request asylum, which comes under federal authority, and experts caution their presence could be confusing. <br />“In my experience, speaking with newcomers, I think they certainly feel apprehensive,” Hanne Sandison, director of the refugee and immigrant program at the Advocates for Human Rights non-profit, said.</p><p>She added: “They have really clear and consistent stories across the board of intimidating interactions with some sort of authority at the border. I think it’s not always clear to them who is who.”</p><p>The medical teams commonly stand ready on the US side of the border, welcoming people and directing them to medical tents or to wait for federal immigration agents to arrive.</p><p>“Unfortunately, both governors DeSantis and Abbott have used tools of assistance in many different ways through the past couple of years to support newcomers’ lives and put political points on the line,” Sandison said.</p><p>The Texas health department noted in a statement to the Guardian that the Florida medical personnel who arrived late last month will be spread roughly from El Paso at the western end of the Texas-Mexico border to Eagle Pass, 500 miles to the south-west and will “augment services wherever needed”.</p><p>Other states that have announced plans to send medical teams to Texas, though in much smaller numbers than Florida, include North Dakota, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, West Virginia, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Mississippi.</p><p>One Texas official with experience assisting newcomers, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, fearing reprimand, said out-of-state medical teams were helpful and a “huge resource” to migration, and some enjoy the mission, others don’t.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Austin, a new way of thinking about migration has been catalyzed by initiatives like ReLeaf, which sees newcomers as a valuable resource rather than a burden. The organization has led efforts to host job fairs to recruit as many new arrivals as possible, viewing them as potential contributors to the local economy and community.</p><p>DeSantis signed pro-immigration legislation into law last month shortly before formally declaring his run for president.<br />The law encourages Floridians to help newcomers and makes it easier for immigrants to find work, while the governor has caused a stir by orchestrating transportation to take newcomers from Texas to job fairs in Sacramento, California, and Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, with reported promises of prearranged jobs and housing.</p><p>“These are human beings, they’re not political pawns and we can and should do better as a country,” Sandison said, adding: “Responding in this way is uplifting and people will thrive and communities will grow.”<br />The offices of the Texas and Florida governors did not provide comment.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><div class="item-list"><ul><li><a href="../../solarpunk-fiction.html" hreflang="en">SolarPunk Fiction</a>
