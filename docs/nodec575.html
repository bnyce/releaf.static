He studied things like science and philosophy and wanted to understand how everything in the world is connected. He thought that instead of thinking of everything as separate, we should think of everything as one big thing that's always moving and changing. This way of thinking can help us be nicer to each other and take care of our planet better. We can even make gardens in unexpected places to show how everything is connected!</span></p></div>

First, we'll need some plastic containers that have holes in the bottom. We'll put a string or a hose through the holes to help water the plants. We'll also need some fabric to keep the dirt from falling out of the holes. Then, we'll stack the containers on top of each other and put them on a fence. We'll put a big tray of water at the bottom to help keep the plants nice and wet.</p></div>
