It's a special pot that we use to grow plants in. Sometimes, we don't have to go to the store to buy a planter because we can make one ourselves! We can use things around the house that we don't need anymore, like old clothes, CDs, or broken glass. We can even paint them and decorate them with pretty stones or shells. It's important to make sure everything we use is safe for plants and that we handle things like broken glass carefully. And remember, it's okay if our planter looks a little different because we used recycled things to make it!</p></div>

Here are a few ideas:</p><p>1. Paint: Leftover paint from other projects can be used to turn a drab cardboard or plastic bottle into a bright, colorful planter. Just make sure the paint is non-toxic and safe for plants.</p><p>2. Fabric and Twine: Old clothes, curtains, or other fabric can be cut into strips and wrapped around the planter for a chic, textured look. Twine or yarn can also add a rustic touch.</p></div>

He didn't need a wand to do magic, he used something called "Trash Magic." He took things that people didn't want anymore, like old cardboard boxes, and turned them into beautiful gardens. He even taught other people how to do it too! Now the city is covered in green, with flowers and vegetables growing everywhere. Cali's magic helped make the city a better place, and it made him feel good too. Even though he did some bad things in the past, he was able to do good things now and help the environment.</span></p></div>
