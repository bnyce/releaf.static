Clean the Can: Rinse the aluminum can out thoroughly with warm water and soap to ensure it's clean and free of any residues.</p><p>2. Drainage Holes: Turn the can upside down and, using a drill or nail and hammer, create a few drainage holes in the bottom. Be sure to wear safety gloves during this process to avoid any sharp edges.</p><p>At this point, you have your basic, vertically oriented aluminum can planter. Now, let's discuss some incremental ways to upcycle this planter:</p></div>

            <div><p>Hey there! Do you know what a planter is? It's a special pot that we use to grow plants in. Sometimes, we don't have to go to the store to buy a planter because we can make one ourselves! We can use things around the house that we don't need anymore, like old clothes, CDs, or broken glass. We can even paint them and decorate them with pretty stones or shells. It's important to make sure everything we use is safe for plants and that we handle things like broken glass carefully. And remember, it's okay if our planter looks a little different because we used recycled things to make it!</p></div>

Paint: Leftover paint from other projects can be used to turn a drab cardboard or plastic bottle into a bright, colorful planter. Just make sure the paint is non-toxic and safe for plants.</p><p>2. Fabric and Twine: Old clothes, curtains, or other fabric can be cut into strips and wrapped around the planter for a chic, textured look. Twine or yarn can also add a rustic touch.</p></div>
